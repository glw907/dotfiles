# Bluefin bootstrap

Bootstrap artifacts for converting a workstation from Linux Mint to Bluefin
DX (stable). Decisions record and fact base: `MIGRATION-BRIEF.md`. Read that
file first; this directory implements it and does not repeat its reasoning.

## Quick card: fresh Bluefin to working machine

Every command to type on the new system, in order.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glw907/workstation.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh devmode   # answer: yes, no, no
sudo systemctl reboot
~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh layer
sudo systemctl reboot
~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh setup
# 1Password app: sign in, then Settings -> Developer -> "Integrate with 1Password CLI"
~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh restore
claude   # first launch asks you to log in
```

Two reboots, both required. The official ISO installs the non-DX `bluefin`
image; `devmode` rebases to `bluefin-dx` and only takes effect on boot, and
`layer` must run against the image that is actually booted. `layer` and
`setup` both hard-stop if they find themselves on a non-DX image.

`setup` prints a verification checklist at the end; read it before moving on
to `restore`.

| `MIGRATION-BRIEF.md` | Decisions, verified platform facts, backup state |
| `bootstrap.sh` | `devmode`, `layer`, `setup`, and `restore` phases, run in order below |
| `layered-packages.txt` | The minimal rpm-ostree layered set |
| `flatpaks.txt` | Flatpak app IDs to install |

| `stow-packages.txt` | The Stow packages this repo manages, single source of truth |
| `etc/` | Captured `/etc` drops: chromium policies, android udev rule |

## Order of operations, fresh install

1. Write the Bluefin ISO with Fedora Media Writer, install to `stable` with
   whole-disk LUKS. Enable "Allow Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA" in BIOS
   first. There is no separate DX ISO — the image is unified and installs
   non-DX `bluefin`; DX comes from the `devmode` rebase in step 4.
2. First boot: enroll the MOK (password `universalblue`).
3. Clone dotfiles:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/glw907/workstation.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```
4. Rebase to the Developer Experience image:
   ```
   ~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh devmode
   ```
   This wraps `ujust devmode`, which prompts three times: answer **yes** to
   enabling developer mode, then **no** to the default development flatpaks
   and **no** to the extra monospace fonts. Both declines are deliberate.
   Flatpaks come from `flatpaks.txt`, so the second workstation gets the same
   tracked set. The fonts are simply not needed: the base image already ships
   JetBrains Mono and Symbols Nerd Font Mono, which is all `kitty.conf` asks
   for, and Ptyxis uses the system monospace.
5. Reboot into the DX image.
6. Layer packages and add the 1Password repo:
   ```
   ~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh layer
   ```
7. Reboot (the layered packages need the new deployment applied).
8. Run the rest of setup:
   ```
   ~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh setup
   ```
   Read the verification checklist it prints at the end before moving on.
9. Selective restore from the encrypted backup:
   ```
   ~/.dotfiles/bluefin/bootstrap.sh restore
   ```
   This decrypts the backup, verifies its checksum, and selectively restores
   `$HOME` content, with hard stops on a dirty dotfiles checkout or a
   checksum mismatch. It prints a checklist at the end covering the judgment
   calls that remain: re-authentication, verification, and diffing the
   restored `~/.local/bin` against the `bin` Stow package.

## Second workstation

This same directory provisions the second workstation arriving a few weeks
after thinkpad-x1: same ISO, same `bootstrap.sh devmode` / `layer` / `setup`
sequence, same package lists. A custom uBlue image is a later decision point,
not assumed here — though note that a custom image is the standard way to
avoid the devmode rebase and the Flatpak removals below, by baking both into
the image instead of undoing them per machine.

## Changing the layered package set

`layered-packages.txt` stays minimal by design. Before adding a package to
it, record the reason in `MIGRATION-BRIEF.md`. That file is the source the
list is curated from, not the other way around.

## Android

The SDK lives in `~/Android/`, outside this repo, and is not Stow-managed.
`bin/.local/bin/update-android-sdk` checks it for platform-tools, build-tools,
and platform updates via `sdkmanager`; run it directly or through
`workstation-update`.

USB device access (adb, fastboot) is granted through `etc/udev/51-android.rules`,
staged here and installed to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` by `setup_etc_drops` during
`bootstrap.sh setup`. It tags matching devices `uaccess` rather than adding a
`plugdev` group membership: Bluefin has no `plugdev` group, and `uaccess` is
the systemd-native equivalent, granting access to the user at the active
console session.
