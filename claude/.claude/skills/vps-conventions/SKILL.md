name: vps-conventions
description: Use when writing or modifying systemd units (services, timers, path units), cloud-init user-data, provisioning or deploy scripts, or anything that places files, locks, or directories on a Linux VPS (AlmaLinux/RHEL-family). Also use when choosing where a lock file, temp file, or state file lives, or when a unit fails with mount-namespacing or missing-directory errors.

# VPS conventions

Rules for box-side infrastructure on this workstation's estates (dubplate and
successors). Not a general sysadmin reference — `man systemd.exec` exists.
This skill holds the judgment calls that generic references skip, each one
paid for by a production failure.

## Directory lifetimes decide where things live

| Path | Lifetime | Belongs there | Never there |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RuntimeDirectory=` (`/run/<x>`) | Deleted when the unit stops; tmpfs, gone at boot | Per-run scratch, credential temp files | Locks, anything a second process or unit reads |
| `StateDirectory=` / `/var/lib/<x>` | Persistent | Lock files, ledgers, run reports | Secrets that should die with the run |
| `PrivateTmp=` | Private to the unit, gone at stop | The unit's own `/tmp` use | Anything shared |

- **A lock file in a RuntimeDirectory is a bug.** The directory vanishes
  between runs (interactive tools die on `exec N>` under `set -e`), and
  systemd deletes the lock file at unit stop, so a long-lived holder keeps
  an unlinked inode while the next run locks a fresh file — mutual
  exclusion silently lost. Locks go on a persistent path, and the acquirer
  `mkdir -p`s the parent first (self-healing beats lifecycle coupling).
- **RuntimeDirectory is not reference-counted across units.** Two units
  naming the same directory: the first to stop removes it. Never share one
  expecting persistence.

## Hardening

Every service unit carries `NoNewPrivileges=yes`, `PrivateTmp=yes`, and
`ProtectSystem=strict` with explicit `ReadWritePaths=` for its real write
targets — including template units (`foo@.service`) and OnFailure helpers,
which are the ones that get forgotten. Timers carry `RandomizedDelaySec`;
know that `Persistent=true` fires missed runs at boot.

- **A `ReadWritePaths=` entry must exist on the host before the unit
  starts** or startup fails with "Failed to set up mount namespacing". The
  unit's own script cannot create it; the deploy/provision step pre-creates
  it, and the deploy comment names every unit that depends on it.
- New directories under `/var/lib` on an SELinux-enforcing box inherit
  `var_lib_t` — fine for unconfined services, but verify once on the first
  real deploy rather than assuming.

## Path units and triggers

`PathChanged=` fires on close-after-write; `PathModified=` on every write —
choose deliberately for `touch`-style triggers. The path unit deactivates
while its service runs and re-arms on exit: events coalesce to at most one
follow-up, and events in the re-arm gap are lost. A path-unit trigger is
therefore only acceptable with a timer backstop. The trigger directory must
be writable by every writer under their hardening (`RuntimeDirectory=` on
both, or `MakeDirectory=` on the path unit).

## cloud-init

Runs at **first boot only**. It never converges a live box: a package added
to `user-data.yaml` reaches existing boxes only via a live remediation, and
the change lands in the same commit as the runbook's presence-gate update,
so a fresh provision and the gate can't drift apart. Before adding a
package to a `set -e` first-boot script, prove it exists in the target
repos (`podman run --rm almalinux:10 dnf -q list <pkg>`) — a guessed
package name bricks first boot unattended. Order runcmd so an optional
repo's failure can't take down packages that don't need it.

## Deploy scripts

Idempotent, with a `--check` mode preserved for every step. Know your
manifest semantics: rsync exits 23 on a missing source, so a deleted file
still listed in a manifest array aborts the whole deploy — manifest edits
land in the same commit as the deletion. Stage remote files via `mktemp`,
never fixed `/tmp` names. Pin and checksum anything piped to a root shell.

## Gate

`systemd-analyze verify` on every unit in the repo gate. A unit that cannot
be verified in CI is reviewed by reading the scripts it runs and declaring
its write targets — "argued statically" is acceptable, "assumed" is not.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The service creates its RuntimeDirectory, so the path exists" | Only while that unit runs. Anything else reading it races its lifecycle. |
| "`ReadWritePaths` will allow the dir once the script mkdirs it" | Startup fails before the script runs. Pre-create on the host. |
| "The path unit will catch every trigger" | Coalesced while active, lost in the re-arm gap. Timer backstop required. |
| "Add the package to cloud-init and the box has it" | Only the next box. Live boxes need remediation, same commit as the gate update. |
| "It's a helper/template unit, hardening is for the main services" | Helpers run with the same privileges. Harden every unit. |
