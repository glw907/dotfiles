# Workstation secrets sync — decrypts values.age and pushes secrets to local and Cloudflare targets.
#
# Authenticates to 1Password at most ONCE per login session: the age private key is
# fetched on first use and cached in tmpfs (same shared cache as secret-set.sh), then
# reused by later runs: no repeat desktop-approval prompts. The cache is wiped on
# reboot, when the `claude` shell function exits, or via secret-session-clear.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   sync.sh               # Sync local + all workers
#   sync.sh --local       # Local secrets only (no worker push)
#   sync.sh --worker NAME # Push to a single named worker
#   sync.sh --dry-run     # Show what would be pushed, no changes made
#   sync.sh --verify      # Diff targets vs registry; exits non-zero if mismatch
#
# Design notes:
#   - Private age key persists only in 1Password and the tmpfs session cache.
#   - Decrypted secrets written to /dev/shm (tmpfs, not persisted to disk).
#   - Trap ensures shred cleans up temp files even if script exits early.
#   - Use count=$((count + 1)) not ((count++)) — the latter aborts under set -e.
